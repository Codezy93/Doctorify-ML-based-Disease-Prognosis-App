## Introduction
Doctorify is a comprehensive healthcare application developed using Flutter and Dart, designed to operate seamlessly across multiple platforms including Android, iOS, Web, Windows, macOS, and Linux. The application empowers users by providing a primary prognosis based on their symptoms and offers recommendations on medications, remedies, prevention strategies, precautions, and dietary suggestions. By leveraging advanced AI technologies, Doctorify aims to bridge the gap in healthcare accessibility, especially in rural regions where medical facilities are limited.

## Project Information

### Abstract
Doctorify explores the integration of AI in healthcare to enhance accessibility and provide preliminary medical guidance to users. The application allows users to input a paragraph describing their symptoms, which is processed by a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract relevant symptoms. These symptoms are then fed into a multi-class classification pipeline utilizing ensemble machine learning techniques, including Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers, to predict potential medical conditions. The system offers personalized recommendations, making healthcare information more accessible to underserved populations.

### Problem Statement
Healthcare accessibility is a significant challenge in rural regions, where medical facilities and professionals are scarce. Residents often lack immediate access to medical advice, leading to delayed diagnoses and treatments. Existing solutions are either too complex or not tailored to the needs of rural users. There is a critical need for an intuitive, accessible tool that can provide preliminary medical assessments and recommendations based on user-inputted symptoms.

### Objective
The primary objectives of Doctorify are:
- **Accessibility**: Provide an easy-to-use platform that operates across various devices and platforms.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allow users to input symptoms in natural language, eliminating the need for technical knowledge.
- **Accurate Prognosis**: Utilize advanced machine learning models to predict potential conditions based on user symptoms.
- **Comprehensive Recommendations**: Offer users advice on medications, remedies, prevention, precautions, and diet.
- **Empowerment**: Enable users, especially in rural areas, to make informed decisions about their health.

### Literature Review
The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in healthcare has been transformative, offering novel solutions for disease prediction, diagnosis, and patient care optimization. Several studies have explored the efficacy of various ML algorithms in medical prognosis and the potential of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in interpreting patient data.

**AI in Healthcare Diagnostics**

Machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest and XGBoost, have been extensively used for predictive modeling in healthcare. For instance, Liaw and Wiener (2002) highlighted the robustness of Random Forest in handling noisy data and its applicability in classification tasks within medical datasets.

Similarly, Chen and Guestrin (2016) introduced XGBoost, demonstrating its superior performance in classification tasks due to its gradient boosting framework, which has been beneficial in improving precision in medical predictions.

**Natural Language Processing in Symptom Analysis**

The use of NLP and Large Language Models (LLMs) has been pivotal in extracting meaningful information from unstructured text data, such as patient symptom descriptions. Johnson et al. (2016) discussed the utilization of LLMs in interpreting electronic health records (EHRs), which aligns with Doctorify's approach to parsing user-inputted symptom descriptions.

**Accessibility of Healthcare in Rural Areas**

Research by Smith et al. (2018) emphasized the disparity in healthcare accessibility between urban and rural regions, underscoring the need for AI-driven tools to bridge this gap. Their findings support the development of applications like Doctorify, which aim to provide medical assistance to underserved populations.

**Ensemble Methods in Medical Predictions**

The effectiveness of ensemble methods in improving prediction accuracy in medical diagnoses has been documented by Polikar (2006). The study elaborated on how combining multiple models can lead to better generalization and robustness, which is a technique employed in Doctorify's predictive engine.

**Mobile Health Applications for Symptom Checking**

Research on mobile health (mHealth) applications by Fiordelli, Diviani, and Schulz (2013) revealed the growing reliance on smartphones for health information and symptom checking, validating the importance of platforms like Doctorify in modern healthcare delivery.

### Proposed Methodology
Doctorify's methodology involves several key components:

1. **Symptom Input**:
    
    - Users enter a descriptive paragraph of their symptoms.
    - The input is designed to be as natural and unrestricted as possible to accommodate users with varying literacy levels.
2. **LLM-Based Symptom Parsing**:
    
    - The input text is processed using a Large Language Model.
    - The LLM extracts a list of symptoms present in the user's description.
    - This approach simplifies the user's task by eliminating the need to select symptoms from extensive lists.
3. **Machine Learning Prediction**:
    
    - The extracted symptoms are input into a multi-class classification pipeline.
    - **Random Forest Classifier**:
        - Provides robustness to noise and handles high-dimensional data effectively.
        - Offers better generalization by averaging multiple decision trees.
    - **XGBoost Classifier**:
        - Optimizes performance on misclassified conditions.
        - Improves precision through gradient boosting techniques.
    - The ensemble of these classifiers enhances overall prediction accuracy.
4. **Recommendation System**:
    
    - Based on the predicted condition, the system generates personalized recommendations.
    - Recommendations include:
        - **Medications**: Suggested over-the-counter drugs or advising consultation with a healthcare professional.
        - **Remedies**: Home remedies and practices to alleviate symptoms.
        - **Prevention**: Strategies to prevent the onset or recurrence of the condition.
        - **Precautions**: Advice on actions to avoid worsening the condition.
        - **Diet**: Nutritional guidance to support recovery and overall health.
5. **User Interface and Experience**:
    
    - Developed with Flutter to ensure consistency across all platforms.
    - Emphasizes simplicity and ease of navigation.
    - Incorporates multilingual support to cater to a diverse user base.
